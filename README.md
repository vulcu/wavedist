## General Info
This project makes things sound bad, but in a good way.

## Features ##
* sliders
* now in stereo!

	
## Algorithms: ##
This project uses the following algorithms for waveshaping:
```
 1) soft clip alg:        y[n] = (1.5*x[n]) - (0.5*x[n]^3);
 2) leaky integrator alg: y[n] = ((1 - A) * x[n]) + (A * y[n - 1]);
 3) soft knee clip alg:   y[n] = x[n] / (K * abs(x[n]) + 1);
 4) cubic soft clip alg:  y[n] = (1.5 * threshold * HardClip(x[n])) -
                                ((0.5 * HardClip(x[n])^3) / threshold);
 5) warp alg: y[n] = (((x[n] * 1.5) - (0.5 * x[n]^3)) * (((2 * K) / (1 - K))
                    + 1)) / ((abs((x[n] * 1.5) - (0.5 * x[n]^3)) 
                    * ((2 * K) / (1 - K))) + 1);
 6) rectify alg: y[n] = ((1 - R) * softclip(x[n])) + (|softclip(x[n])| * R);
```
	
## Setup
To run this project, install it locally into your systems's `/Reaper/Effects` folder. On Windows 10, JSFX effects are usually located in `%appdata%\Reaper\Effects`. You may want to install it into another folder within that folder, such as %appdata%\Reaper\Effects\vulcu`
